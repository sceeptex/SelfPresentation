st.write("""The development of the electric charger Dashboard in Power BI is a major step forward for ABB service technicians. With this powerful tool, technicians are able to gain valuable insights into the performance and usage of each EV charger, helping them to provide the best possible service to customers.

Previously, technicians faced challenges in quickly identifying and resolving problems with EV chargers. They had to rely on manual methods to gather data and diagnose issues, which was time-consuming and error-prone. With the electric charger Dashboard in Power BI, this is no longer the case.

The dashboard provides real-time data on problems, usage patterns, and malfunctioning components, enabling technicians to quickly and accurately identify and fix issues. In addition, the dashboard can be used to perform predictive maintenance, which can prevent potential problems from arising in the first place. This is particularly useful in ensuring the reliability and performance of EV chargers, which is essential for providing top-quality service to customers.

Overall, the electric charger Dashboard in Power BI is a game-changing tool for ABB service technicians. It enables them to work more efficiently and effectively, helping them to provide the best possible service to customers.""")

    In this university project, we used regression models and the XGBoost algorithm to predict rent prices for a dataset of rental properties in Germany. We collected and cleaned the dataset, trained a machine learning model using XGBoost, and evaluated its performance. We also compared our results to other regression methods and found that our model was able to provide more accurate and reliable predictions. Furthermore, we optimized the model hyperparameters with a Bayesian Search algorithm and achieved even better results. In addition to our technical findings, we also made recommendations for our peers on the best locations and types of apartments to consider when looking for a flat in Mannheim. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of XGBoost for rent price prediction and provides valuable insights into the factors that influence rent prices in Mannheim""")

This was my first project with Python and I learned a lot about machine learning and signal processing. Our goal was to develop what we call soft sensors, which are sensors that can be easily attached and use advanced computing techniques to extract information from data that is otherwise difficult or impossible to measure. By harnessing the power of machine learning and data processing techniques, we aimed to develop a new approach that would provide more accurate and comprehensive insights into physical phenomena. Through our research, we have gained a deeper understanding of the capabilities of motion sensors and how they can be used to develop advanced, intelligent sensing systems.")

As the complexity and scope of these systems continue to grow, it becomes increasingly important to carefully monitor and manage changes to these objects to ensure smooth and seamless operation of the SAP system. In this project, we wanted to address this challenge by developing a system that automatically classifies changes based on a risk matrix. This risk matrix takes into account the probability of occurrence and impact that each development object can have. This involves checking in how many other developments the object is used and thus how high its dependency is, as well as analyzing the individual components of each development object. By implementing our system, we can gain a more detailed view of the changes that are being made to the SAP system and can take appropriate steps to ensure that these changes do not affect the stability, security, and performance of the SAP system.""")
